## Introduction
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project aims to analyze the factors that influenced the survival of passengers and to build a machine learning model to predict whether a given passenger would survive based on these factors.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the well-known Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including their age, sex, passenger class, fare, and whether they survived.

The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
